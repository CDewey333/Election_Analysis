In Summary, this script could be used (with some modifications) for any election held in the state of Colorado. Or any state for that matter. All that would have to change is the vote data. The county and candidate names could be easily changed with the vote data being displayed exactly like this script. One way this script could be modified to be used for other elections would be easily changing the “counties.dict” for any other set of criteria you had data for. Another way this script could be modified to be used for other elections would be easily changing the data set. It’s only referenced on one line of the script. That would be easy to switch out.
